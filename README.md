Simple Strategy Guide and Tips  
When you start firing at a large ball, stay focused on the medium and small balls that spawn from it.  
Don't start shooting a medium or large ball and then turn your back on it.  
The small alienship does not shoot towards you, he shoots where you were.  
Press pause when you need to scratch your nose.  

Here are the shout-outs  
Profit! - when an alienship spawns and immediately runs into a bullet.  
Chicken! - running and firing directly at a small alienship with no intention of hitting hyperspace.  
Wormhole! - traveling through the edge of space while continuously shooting balls and aliens.  
Revenge! - pressing hyperspace to avoid a ball or alien, then you respawn facing it and kill it.  
Hanging by a thread! - when your playing with your final ship, then you shoot a small alienship, win a free ship, and then get killed by his bullet.  
ChinMusic! - barely rotating out of the way when a ball or alien grazes your port or starboard sides.  
ClothesLine! - rotating your ship and shooting a string of bullets in front of the small alienship to kill it.
