Simple Strategy Guide and Tips  
When you start to shoot a large ball, stay focused on the medium and small balls that spawn from it.  
Don't start shooting a medium or large ball and the turn your back on it.  
Be sure to hang out in the middle of the screen before the next wave of balls spawn.  
Press pause when you need to scratch your nose.  

Here are the shout-outs  
Profit! - when an alienship spawns and immediately runs into a bullet.  
Chicken! - running and firing directly at a small alienship with no intention of hitting hyperspace.  
Wormhole! - shooting balls and aliens through the edge of space.  
Revenge! - pressing hyperspace to avoid a ball or alien, then you respawn facing it and kill it.  
Hanging by a thread! - when your playing with your final ship, then you shoot a small alienship, win a free ship, and then get killed.  
ChinMusic! - barely rotating out of the way when a ball or alien grazes your port or starboard sides.  
ClothesLine! - shooting a string of bullets in front of an alienship and he runs into it.
